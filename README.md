# Lung Cancer Quiz

Flask website where users can answer a set of Yes/No questions to test their risk of getting lung cancer. Implemented a deep-learning classification model 
using Tensorflow to predict lung cancer with a dataset from Kaggle. Achieved 91% accuracy on the test data, and the model was implemented into the website.
